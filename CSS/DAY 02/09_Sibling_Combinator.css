/* 
ADJACENT SIBLING COMBINATOR EXPLAINED:
- Symbol: + (plus sign)
- Syntax: element1 + element2
- Target: element2 that immediately follows element1
- Same parent: Both elements must share the same parent
- Immediate: No elements between them (whitespace/text nodes don't count)

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
<p>User name</p>        ← First element
<h3>Question</h3>       ← Second element (gets styled)

NOT MATCHED:
<p>User name</p>
<span>Something</span>  ← Breaks adjacency
<h3>Question</h3>       ← Won't be styled

SPECIFICITY: (0,0,0,2) - two element selectors
PRACTICAL USE: Style elements based on their position relative to siblings
