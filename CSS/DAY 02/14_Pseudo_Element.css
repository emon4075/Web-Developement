/* 
PSEUDO-ELEMENT SELECTORS EXPLAINED:
- Syntax: element::pseudo-element { properties }
- Target: Specific parts or virtual elements within real elements
- Double colon (::) distinguishes from pseudo-classes (:)
- Create styled content without additional HTML markup

COMMON PSEUDO-ELEMENTS:
- ::first-letter - first character of element
- ::first-line - first line of element
- ::selection - highlighted/selected text
- ::before - virtual element before content
- ::after - virtual element after content

SPECIFICITY: Same as element selector (0,0,0,1)

PRACTICAL USES:
- Drop caps with ::first-letter
- Special first line styling with ::first-line
- Custom text selection colors with ::selection
