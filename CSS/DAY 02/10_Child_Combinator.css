/* CHILD COMBINATOR: Targets direct children elements only (not descendants) */

span>button {
    /* CHILD COMBINATOR: button that is direct child of span */
    color: red;
    /* TEXT COLOR: red text */
    background-color: black;
    /* BACKGROUND: black background */
}

/* Targets only immediate button children, not nested ones */

/* 
CHILD COMBINATOR EXPLAINED:
- Symbol: > (greater than)
- Syntax: parent > child
- Target: Direct children only (immediate descendants)
- Specificity: (0,0,0,2) - two element selectors

DIFFERENCE FROM DESCENDANT SELECTOR:
- span button: targets ANY button inside span (descendant)
- span > button: targets ONLY direct button children of span (child)

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE THAT MATCHES:
<span>
    <button>Click me</button>     ← MATCHES (direct child)
</span>

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T MATCH:
<span>
    <div>
        <button>Click me</button> ← DOESN'T MATCH (not direct child, it's grandchild)
    </div>
</span>

PRACTICAL USE: Precise targeting when you need specific parent-child relationships
